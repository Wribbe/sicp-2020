; Exercise 1.7
; ------------

; 1.) Very small numbers:
;   An absolute cut-off of 0.001 will fail if both values are smaller than the
;   cut-off, which always produces a value lower than the absolute cut-off.

; 2.) Very large numbers:
;   When working with large numbers the loss off precision due to limited bits
;   can affect the resolution of the new better result. Meaning there is no
;   improvement -> infinit loop.
